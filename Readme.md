# How to show map pins using data from ASPxGridView


<p>To show dxMap, it is first necessary to create a div tag with an ID that will be used in code as a container. Then, handle the ASPxGridView's <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxGridViewASPxGridView_CustomJSPropertiestopic">CustomJSProperties</a> event that allows passing a custom array of city names and their coordinates from the server side to the client. After that, use this array in a function that creates a dxMap instance and shows map pins with names of the cities at required coordinates. Handle the client-side <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxClassesScriptsASPxClientControl_Inittopic">Init</a> event to show the map when the page is loaded. To show filtered results, handle the client-side <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxGridViewScriptsASPxClientGridView_BeginCallbacktopic">BeginCallback</a> event to set a flag (the "filtering" variable) when the ASPxGridView executes filter commands. Finally, handle <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxGridViewScriptsASPxClientGridView_EndCallbacktopic">EndCallback</a>, which fires only when the flag is set and reset map markers.<br>dxMap is created in the createMap function on the client side. And then, map properties are set to dxMap's <em>markers</em> option. Iterate through the cities' array stored in the ASPxClientGrid's "cpCities" JS property and create a pins array. After that, assign this array to the markers option using the <a href="https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxMap/Methods/#optionoptionName_optionValue">option</a> method. Refer to the <a href="https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxMap/">dxMap</a> topic to get more information about dxMap.<br><br><strong>For versions older than 17.1, see implementation details below.</strong></p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Additional&nbsp;information to the description above:<br><br>You can show a google map instead of dxMap. It is necessary to create a div tag with an ID that will be used in code later. Then, pass the required map coordinates as described above.<br>A map is created in the createMap function in our client-side javascript code. The function first checks whether the variable that contains the map exists and, if so, destroys a previous instance. Create an object with map properties and then pass it to the map object constructor. Call the function which iterates through the cities' array stored in the ASPxClientGrid's "cpCities", because this array is passed in CustomJSProperties. The addPin function, which is called in addCityPins, adds pins to the map, thus adding a&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg427615.aspx"><u>pushpin</u></a>&nbsp;entity to the&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg427616.aspx"><u>entity collection</u></a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg427609.aspx"><u>map class</u></a>.
